# Project: Chat with PDF using Gemini

This project is a PDF-based conversational interface built with Streamlit and various AI tools. It allows users to upload PDF documents, process the text from these documents, and interact with the content using a chat interface. The core functionality is powered by Google's Gemini model, integrated through LangChain.

## Key Features:
1. **PDF Text Extraction:** The project extracts text from uploaded PDF files.
2. **Text Chunking:** The extracted text is split into chunks for better processing.
3. **Vector Store:** The text chunks are stored in a vector store (using FAISS) with embeddings generated by Google Generative AI.
4. **Conversational AI:** Users can ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs. The system searches the vector store for relevant chunks and generates a detailed answer using the Gemini model.

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
   - Make sure you have Python installed. It’s recommended to use Python 3.8 or later.
   - Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows:** 
       ```bash
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **macOS/Linux:** 
       ```bash
       source env/bin/activate
       ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
   - Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### 3. Set Up API Key
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project if it doesn’t already exist.
   - Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
     ```

### 4. Run the Streamlit Application
   - Start the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run <your-python-file>.py
     ```
   - Replace `<your-python-file>` with the name of your Python script file (e.g., `main.py`).

### 5. Interact with the Application
   - Open the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.
   - Upload your PDF files using the sidebar.
   - After processing, ask questions about the content of your PDFs, and the app will provide answers based on the PDF content using the Gemini model.

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure your `.gitignore` file is correctly set up to prevent sensitive information and unnecessary files from being tracked by Git. The `.env` file containing your API key should be in the `.gitignore`.
- If you are running this on a remote server or a cloud-based environment, ensure that your API key is securely managed.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run and interact with your project.
